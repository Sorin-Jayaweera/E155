The first ensured connection between the FPGA and the on-board LEDs, and the second required the FPGA to pull a pin on the MCU high, each driving led’s depending on their current state. The third test was using pins on the PCB to control a number displayed on the 7 segment display, as well as on-board LEDS to understand the internal state.\n\n\nSimulation\nThe 7 segment display code was verified first in simulation. A test bench was constructed with all user inputs (hex numbers 0 - 15), with the desired led and display states. The timing LED was not tested in simulation.\nThe simulation passed all tests.\n\n\nTestbench Simulation\nThe simulation included each possible stimulus from the user for numbers 0 - 15, as well as each case necessary to test the led status behavior.\nShown is a “main” testbench, which includes both the LED and 7 segment display. Two other testbench files were run using the same testbench framework. See all three testvector files.\n\nThe testbench concluded 15 tests with 0 errors."

    "text": "Technical Documentation\n\nBlock Diagram\nThe block diagram for the 7 segment display is shown below. This describes the internal structure of the FPGA.\nThe FPGA controls the main logic, with an input binary number from from 0000 to 1111 and converts it to control for two the on board leds. It also drives a third led by a 2.4 hz clock signal.\nThe FPGA also converts the input binary number to control over the 7 segment display to show the input number in decimal form.\n\n\n\nSchematic\nThe schematic describes the assembled circuit shown below. First is a photo of the assembled circuit, then a schematic. For more detail on the PCB, see the HMC E155 Design reference: ()[https://pages.hmc.edu/brake/class/e155/fa23/assets/doc/E155%20Development%20Board%20Schematic.pdf]\n\n\n\n\nPins:\nThe pins used for the code inputs and outputs are as specified: Inputs: S3: 32 S2: 35 S1: 31 S0: 37 Reset: 23\nOutputs: seg[6]: 13 seg[5]: 18 seg[4]: 19 seg[3]: 11 seg[2]: 6 seg[1]: 9 seg[0]: 44 led[2]: 42 led[1]: 38 led[0]: 28\n\nResistor and Current Calculations\nThe Resistor was chosen to be 1k \\(\\Omega\\). At minimum there are 2 of them active at once, maximum 7 - both of these situations must be considered for determining the resistor specification.\nEach LED has a maximum forward voltage of 1.8V at 20mA per led.\nThe LEDS are all in parallel, not series. For there to actually be a voltage drop of 1.8V, there must be a 5-1.8 = 3.2v drop across the resistor that is connecting all of the components.\nThere are, at minimum, two leds that would be on for the 7 segment hex specific display. This means a maximum of 40mA of current.\nThis means that the resistor should be at 3.2v / 40mA = 800 \\(\\Omega\\). For this project, I used 1 \\(k\\Omega\\) to give more room for unstable power supply, since we aren’t near the lower limit of current to light all 7 displays.\nFor more reference see spec sheet: . ## Results and Discussion\nThis brief series of test showed that the hardware is working as expected; The FPGA and MCU were able to properly communicate, and a 7 segment display was properly driven. Further, a 2.4 hz clock signal was generated and used to drive an onboard LED, validated with an oscilloscope.\nAll intended tasks were completed successfully. The design could be improved to provide more consistent current supply. A ribbon cable has not yet been constructed due to insufficient supply. A 7 segment display driven by connections to a constant voltage would allow better control of LED brightness. The present setup distributes current across all leds in the 7 segment display, which decreases the brightness."

This time was spent mixed helping other people and struggling with bugs that were unrelated to code (the programmer is so annoying).

There is likely less common documentation on system verilog and lattice radiant, since it would be a less used tool. Being more niche, there is less for the neural net to train on. The code that it generated has some semblence of sense, but picking through it there are constructions that I don’t understand (either from lack of knowledge on my part or genuine failure to make something better). I tried a couple prompts, but didn’t get any usable feedback from the generator.\nFor other coding projects, Claude code has worked phenominally. However, in this case it is a complete failure, not “understanding” the base errors that I was receiving."
