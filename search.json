The first ensured connection between the FPGA and the on-board LEDs, and the second required the FPGA to pull a pin on the MCU high, each driving led’s depending on their current state. The third test was using pins on the PCB to control a number displayed on the 7 segment display, as well as on-board LEDS to understand the internal state.\n\n\nSimulation\nThe 7 segment display code was verified first in simulation. A test bench was constructed with all user inputs (hex numbers 0 - 15), with the desired led and display states. The timing LED was not tested in simulation.\nThe simulation passed all tests.\n\n\nTestbench Simulation\nThe simulation included each possible stimulus from the user for numbers 0 - 15, as well as each case necessary to test the led status behavior.\nShown is a “main” testbench, which includes both the LED and 7 segment display.

For there to actually be a voltage drop of 1.8V, there must be a 5-1.8 = 3.2v drop across the resistor that is connecting all of the components.\nThis means that the resistor should be at 3.2v / 40mA = 80 \\(\\Omega\\). For this project, I used 100 \\(\\Omega\\) s to give more room for unstable power supply, since we aren’t near the lower limit of current to light all 7 displays.\nFor more reference see spec sheet: ."

The design could be improved to provide more consistent current supply. A ribbon cable has not yet been constructed due to insufficient supply.

The code that it generated has some semblence of sense, but picking through it there are constructions that I don’t understand (either from lack of knowledge on my part or genuine failure to make something better). I tried a couple prompts, but didn’t get any usable feedback from the generator.\nFor other coding projects, Claude code has worked phenominally.

These two inputs are connected alternating at 80 hz. At the same 80hz clock, an enable for the left and right display are activated (only one at a time). The pins controlling the seven segment code are connected to both displays, but only the display with an active enable will show. Because they are switching at high frequency, it appears that both are displaying simultaneously - while in reality it is only one at a time.\nThis time multiplexing saves internal resources, and only uses one set of segment pins + an enable per display instead of using 7 pins per display.\nThe sum of the two binary numbers is sent to the LEDS."

    "text": "Technical Documentation\n\nBlock Diagram\n\nA single look up table is multiplexed with inputs from two inputs, alternating at 80 hz.\n\n\nSchematic\n\nThe output 7 segment control pins are fed to the inputs of both 7 segment displays. The power for each display is controlled by a PNP transistor, which connects the weak enable signal from the FPGA to a 3.3v source.\n\n\nTesting\nTwo simulations were used to verify the behavior of this system. The first checked that the sum of the two binary numbers was properly computed, and the second tested the switching functionality between two displays with the 7 segment output.\nThe following displays holding one display constant while changing the inputs for the other, and we see the display code updating on alternating inputs following the enable for that display. More tests are not screenshot,due to the sheer number (and zooming in to see the binary numbers as validatoin). \nThe following shows that the sum output from the top module is indeed the sum of the two inputs, for every combination of inputs. \nThe frequency of the clock alternating between segment 0 and 1 had to be determined and verified in situ, due to the nature of human eye to discerne which frequency was applicable.\n\n\nPhysical Design Calculations\nThere are several sensitive components on this PCB.\nThe FPGA pins can drive at most \\(\\pm\\) 8 mA of current through IO pins, at 3.3V. The 7 segment display can handle a maximum of 20 mA of current before burnout. The transistor has a 10x amplification from input current to output current - so to protect the displays that the transistors are driving, current at the base should be restricted to 2 mA.\nTo restrict current going to the PNP transistors, a 200 \\(\\Omega\\) resistor was used. There is at max a 0.4 V drop from the collector to emmitter, which. For a maximum current flow of 2 mA, this yields (\\(0.4V/0.02 mA = 200 \\Omega s\\)).\nThe LEDs have a forward voltage of 2.2V and a maximum current of 20 mA, which gives a minimum of 50 \\(\\Omega\\) resistor between the LEDs and ground to restrict current flow, as \\((3.2V - 2.2V)/(20mA) = 50 \\Omega\\). A 200 \\(\\Omega\\) resistor was used."

    "text": "Technical Documentation\n\nClock frequencies\nThe PLL System clock was configured to 80,000,000 HZ (80 MHz). Two timers were used, one to generate a PWM signal to play each note, and one to count each note’s duration/\nTIM15 was used for note duration. This was configured to 10KHZ by using prescaler 7999 (+1 implicit). The timer has 16 bits.\nTIM16 was used for the PWM. This was configured to 100 KHz by using prescaler 799 (+1 implicit). The timer has 16 bits.\nMinimum Duration: The clock has 10000 cycles / second and 16 bits. The minimum duration is 1 cycle, so 1/10000 seconds, or \\(10^{-4}\\) seconds.\nMaximum Duration:\nAt 16 bits, the maximum representable number is \\(2^{16} = 32768\\) cycles. (2^{16} since we count 2^n starting from n=0, and have every number from n=0-15 active, which is 2^{16} - 1) This gets a maximum duration \\((2^{16}) \\text{cycles} * \\frac{1\\text{cycle}}{10000 \\text{seconds}} = 6.55\\) seconds.\nMinimum Frequency: As before, the maximum division of the clock is \\(2^{16}\\). At 100,000 cycles/second /(2^15 cycles) = 1.52 Hz.\nMaximum Frequency: The clock goes at 100 KHz, so that is the minimum frequency.\n\n\nError Calculations\nWe are limited by the division of an integer clock, and can’t perfectly approximate frequencies. A frequency is represented as the closest number\nAny frequency is compressed with an error given by\n\\[\n1-\\frac{\\text{floor}(x)}{(x)}\n\\]\nThe error for this converges to 0 as the frequency increases (up to maximum frequency).\nThe frequency is done by counting up to some number. \\[10Khz/(\\text{floor}(\\frac{100kHz}{\\text{floor(frequency)}}))\\]. In an ideal world there would be no rounding error, hence th error is the ratio between this and the idea without flooring.\n\n\n\nSchematic"
