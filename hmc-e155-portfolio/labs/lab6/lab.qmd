Overview:
The goal of this lab was to make an IOT device which could toggle an LED from a webserver, and could display temperature with a configurable resolution.

## Logic Analyzer

Conclusion:
This lab was not finished succesfully. While data is being read and sent to the temperature sensor, the sensor is not properly updating/communicating temperature information.

The website does host the functionality desired.

## AI Overview
Claude made a fully functioning UI

The code for SPI communications would not have worked however.
