## Introduction

In this lab, a 16 pin keypad was used to read user input. The most recent two displays of which are shown on two seven segments. 
This tests the principles of debouncing and asynchrony. 

This was designed for use with the HMC E155 Development board, which utulizes the UPduino v3.1 and iCE40 UP5k. 

## Design and Testing Methodology

Osilloscope traces were used to verify that the real world hold times for button press and release debounce timers matched expectation - 40 ms each.

A simulation testbench for each module was also created to ensure desired functionality. (albeit they were constructed after it already worked).
 
## Technical Documentation

The logic for this design is partitioned into many functions. There is a

## Testbench Simulation
A testbench was constructed for every module.

## Results and Discussion

The device was constructed to hit each constraint - the keyboard has no debounce toggles and accepts user inputs, and the most recent two digits are displayed. The keypad will not accept any numbers that are pressed for the duration of another button.

The debounce length chosen is somewhat lengthy, and may be reduced for optimization.
