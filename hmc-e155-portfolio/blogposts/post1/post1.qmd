Hi!
Woah this is so cool! Lets figure out the possibilities of this software!
## TESTING MARKDOWN
### THIS TOO?
#### HI!
##### WOAH THATS A LOT OF '#'
###### AARRGGHH. 6 '#'!
# Now lets explore latex!
## $\text{inline? ## header } a^{b} \text{header} $
inline $a^{b}$ not in header
hmmm lets try multiline
$$
\begin{align}
\text{multiline}\\
\text{multiline}\\
\text{multiline}\\
\text{multiline}\\  
\end{align}
$$

Woah!
Nice.
Lets reflect on this: We have a super easy way to generate html and css files and make a personal website. This is huge. I've always wanted to do this, but never had the excuse or time - and was always way too scared. It was totally unfounded. This is awesome. 

In blog style, this shall remain short - but welcome to the start of a fun new adventure in life.
